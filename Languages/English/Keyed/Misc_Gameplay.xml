	<AG_QuestRate>Abandoned biotech labs multiplier (lower means getting the event more often)</AG_QuestRate>
	<AG_QuestRateTooltip>The frequency of the abandoned biotech lab quest being offered is multiplied by this number (with a multiplier of 1, it is offered every between 15 and 30 days at random). Numbers below 1 decrease the time, while numbers above it increase it. Note that this event doesn't "replace" normal quests, it works independently.</AG_QuestRateTooltip>
