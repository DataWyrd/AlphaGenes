		<description>Fleetkind were a misguided attempt at creating a human xenotype capable of flourishing on their own, completely isolated from other external societies. A properly established fleetkind outpost can generate its own electricity and easily replenish its numbers.\n\nFleetkind deviate greatly from baseline humans, and they are often seen as too strange to interact with.</description>

		<description>The lowest of the low on the Rim, helixans were created as a human xenotype that would revel in the presence of decay, filth and refuse. Capable of exuding a foul-smelling, corrosive gas that produces an uncomfortable, itchy sensation in living beings. This gas is mostly harmless, unless it comes into contact with decaying organic matter: it greatly accelerates corpse rotting, liberating a black putrid liquid known as "purge fluid" or corpse bile. The helixans feed through the skin by contacting the liquid sludge, although they can also feed on other organic matter if needed.</description>

		<description>Animusen were genetically spliced with Animus Vox genes to create a cold-thriving human xenotype with a much better -and less aggressive- disposition than Yttakin.\n\nAnimusen have strong psychic abilities, and they are very attuned to the feelings of others, often being valued as adept counsellors.</description>
